 	<h1>	Time, Space, Complexity    </h1>
<p>
	The Time Complexity of an algorithm/code is not equal to the actual time required to execute a particular code, but the number of times a statement executes.
To express the time complexity of an algorithm, we use something called the “Big O notation”. The Big O notation is a language we use to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. It’s how we compare the efficiency of different approaches to a problem, and helps us to make decisions.
</p>
<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> is a parallel concept to time complexity. 
	If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space.
